# ORM Decision Log

This directory contains the architectural decisions and design choices made for the ORM project. Each decision is documented in its own file for better organization and maintainability.

## Decisions

1. [Schema Definition System](001-schema-definition-system.md)

   - Core types and interfaces
   - Field type factories
   - Field modifiers
   - Database mapping strategy

2. [Schema Definition Approach](002-schema-definition-approach.md)

   - Analysis of three approaches:
     - Decorator-based
     - Factory pattern
     - Class Factory (selected)
   - Pros and cons of each approach
   - Implementation details

3. [Database Layer Architecture](003-database-layer-architecture.md)
   - Database abstraction layer design
   - Adapter pattern implementation
   - Query builder strategy
   - Context and goals

## Purpose

This decision log serves as a historical record of architectural decisions and their rationale. It helps:

- Document the reasoning behind key design choices
- Provide context for future development
- Guide new team members
- Maintain consistency in the codebase

## Contributing

When making new architectural decisions:

1. Create a new numbered file in this directory
2. Follow the existing format
3. Update this README to include the new decision
4. Include code examples where relevant
5. Document pros and cons of alternatives considered
